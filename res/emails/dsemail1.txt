Hi -name-,

We've recently made the leap from excel spreadsheets to SQl, to deal with the increased amount of data we have to handle.

I've been trying to summarize our profits for the last quarter. I can't seem to work out how to write a query to do this. Could you take a look at what I've written so far and see if you notice any issues?

Thanks in advance,
Laurie
